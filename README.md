LCMsec - Security for the Lightweight Communications and Marshalling Protocol (LCM)

LCM is a set of libraries and tools for message passing and data marshalling,
targeted at real-time systems where high-bandwidth and low latency are
critical. It provides a publish/subscribe message passing model and automatic
marshalling/unmarshalling code generation with bindings for applications in a
variety of programming languages.

This fork, LCMsec, is a security extensions for LCM. It:
* provides confidentiality, integrity and authenticity to LCM messages
* provides an attribute-based acces control mechanism with multicastgroup, port and channel granularity
* aims to minimize both overhead and computational complexity - as such, LCMsec is designed to be usable in most environments in which LCM is used.
* maintains the decentralized, peer-to-peer nature of LCM: no broker, no central instance to facilitate keyexchange
* is scalable to many peers and capable of dealing with dynamic communication topologies (hosts leaving and joining a channel) efficiently

This is achieved with the use of:
* a hybrid cryptosystem: a symmetric key is shared between all publishers and subscribers to a channel on a specific multicastgroup
* No distinction between subscribers and publishers, each subscriber is also allowed to publish messages. This makes it possible to use a single shared symmetric key, and avoids issues typically associated with multicast authentication
* A built-in, decentralized discovery protocol
* AES/GCM or ChaChaPoly1305 as the underlying authenticated encryption algorithm.
* The Dutta-Barua group key agreement (modified to use EC-Cryptography) to agree on the symmetric key while minimizing the number of network interactions when a publisher or subscriber joins a topic (i.e., is turned on)

For more informations please take a look at the [paper on LCMsec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07095).

# Limitations of LCMsec

* Additional dependencies are Botan and libstdc++.
* Not yet adressed are the issues of rekeying and certificate revocation, which will be a next step. 
* Only C, C++ and Python bindings are available, Python bindings have not been tested recently
* lcm-logger and lcm-spy are not availe
* Only the udpm provider is available

# LCMsec Quickstart guide

* To use security features, you will need generate a root certificate and x509v3 certificate/key-pairs for each node that should communicate. Permissions are written into SAN of those certificates. For a way to generate certificates automatically, refer to `examples/cpp_security/gen_certificates.py`
* The format of the SAN is a URI of the form: `urn:lcmsec:gkexchg:<mcastgroup>:<port>:<channelname>:<user_id>` 
    * example: ` urn:lcmsec:gkexchg:239.255.76.67:7667:channel1:4` (for a channel)
    * for the permission to be part of a multicast group, use the special string "gkexchg_g" and omit the channelname, for instance: ` urn:lcmsec:gkexchg_g:239.255.76.67:7667:4`
* use ```lcm_create_with_security(...) ``` (or use the c++ API in lcm-sec.hpp) to create an LCM instance that has security enabled. This call will block until the group key agreement has finished on all channels for which there are permissions in the certificate
* At this point, just use the created lcm instance as you normally would.

An Example for an application using LCMsec can be found in `examples/cpp_security` folder.

# Roadmap

The LCM project is active again. The current long-term plan is to focus on stability and maintenance
patches to fix longstanding issues. Longer term we're open to evolution of LCM to have additional
features (as long as backwards compatibility is enforced). We're very open to community
feedback and involvement on new features.
